<section id="auctionsystem">
<h1>Live Auction Draft</h1>
<ul>
<li>Each fantasy team owner is given $200 fantasy amount to bid and buy the players.</li>
<li>Minimum of $1 should be spent on each player, hence a team has maximum of $191 to spend on others.</li>
<li>All 140 available IPL players would be available for auction.</li>
<li>Each fantasy team owner would get a chance to nominate a player to start bidding.</li>
<li>Once a fantasy team buys a player then they own him exclusively i.e. no two teams can or would have same player. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> The left over budget can't be carried forward to the IPL season.
<h1>Player Transfer</h1>
<ul>
<li>A fantasy team would start with $100 as purse amount for all players transfer for the IPL season.</li>
<li>After the initial draft, the team can add more players as long as they have free space on their rooster. </li>
<li>In order to add a player, the team has to submit a blind bid (min value of $1), and the winner of the bid would get the player. 
<ul>
  <li>The results of the bid would be declared at 12am (PST) every day of the fantasy game.</li>
  <li>The team can bid on any one and in order to bid they have to specify the player whom they would be willing to drop in case they win the bid. </li>
  <li>If the team loses on the bid then they get to keep their original players.</li>
  <li>A team has time till the 11:59pm to make any changes i.e. submit bids for new players and after that no changes are allowed for the next game. </li>
  <li>A team can opt same player to be dropped for multiple bids. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Player Market</h1>
<ul>
<li>After the initial draft a fantasy team can either drop a player or put him on Market.</li>
<li>The player placed in Market would still be counted as fantasy team's player i.e. the team can't use this position to add new player.</li>
<li>The player place in Market would be available for others to bid and add him on their team.</li>
<li>The current owner would earn the amount which other team have successfully bid on a player placed in Market</li>
<li>Placing a player in the market is only way a team can earn money to spend on transfers.</li>
<li>The results of the market would be announced at 9pm daily, thus allowing the team who lost the player 3 hours to bid and add new players. </li>
</ul>
